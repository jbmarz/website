# website
This is the site for Jbmarz.com which will serve as a source of the following:
*information about myself as a developer, J B Martin.
*the goals and vision which I wish to bring forth through jbmarz.
*link visitors to open source and useful information, tools, or anything which is geared toward providing freedom and worth to everyone.(ie. github projects, gutenburg.com, archive.org...etc)


#Planning Stage Development
  The goal now is to layout a plan to get a basic website up and begin providing worth to the visitors. It should be relatively small site for now but easily scalable as the content and add on tools grow.
  
  ##website outline (rough)
###Home###
##About### 1.Personal information about myself, I wish to give more info about me than my site will ever record about them...reverse the normal process, so to speak. 
           2. The vision of JBMarz.com (to provide a gateway to the best and most useful content online. Content which most individuals may not know is even available to them. Content provided as a free & open source service for the public benefit)
           3. Code of Ethics (not selling visitor info, not tracking beyond basic required, not advertising solely for purpose of profit, but rather only advertising that which we believe to be worthy. Ads that we would be recommending to our closest friends about. In reviewing content we give the truth and only honest opinions, never leading toward a profit by misconception. Should the site make any profit it should be from providing ads that are worthwhile to public interest so that there is never a need to convince anyone it is "good". Integrity as our main interest. support of all Service to others. Free open source! Freedom of information to all mankind.
           
##Contact - just a simple form allowing visitors to contact the site. Requiring only minimum information, i.e. name and email   which we may respond to (ideally it should go to contact@jbmarz.com, currently only address is admin@jbmarz.com so it will serve until more addresses are added.)
          Considering a link to a reddit forum (possibly embed the forum) which would be for open discussion. Would need a moderator bot to keep the forum in line with reddits requirements and not allow spamming the site etc.
          
 ###Coming Soon###
 
 
 1. CHAT BOTS which all can use as a 100% free service(possibly several bots each serving different goals)
   Functions desired: First because should be easy... reword content. (ie. allowing anyone to write professional business appropriate messages to colleagues) also work as a general conversation bot for those who just wish to talk.
  
 Would like to do a COUNSELLING Bot to be a depression aid bot/counseling during bereavement/"friend when you need one"(suicide prevention)
**** I really need help in my goal to build this into a multiple opton counselling or also build a COUPLES COUNCIL AI: where any two individuals may have a converstion from seperate devices either logged on at the same time or on a single device have a turn based type conversation where both may see the others responses and what the bot outputs, each party responding to the bots specific questions to them by name. Would depend upon couple being able to use it properly on this ne.
Ultimately the bot works as a mediator, taking no sides and having no bias between them(wholly objectional rational) aiding the two in coming to an understanding. (doesnt have to be couples, could be any type of relationship, or any disputes being worked through). 
They must log in (could allow alias profiles specific for this so that noone else may intrude or see the conversation between them. If it was hacked it wouldnt be obvious who the two parties were.) 
(a Heavy encryption private chat room and the record of the conversation should be stored for them to be able to return and review at will... the saved record could be sent to them both via email and not stored on server thus not creating liability..???) 
(i think we could give them the option for us to maintain the record uder encryption but be fully up front that while we are actively attempting to keep it private, it can not be fully guaranteed. If they understand and want it saved by us thats fine if not we email it to them)


****DREAM INTERPRETATION AI- user inputs dream in best detail possible and ai lays out possibilities for understanding the dream. Requirements of personal info as this plays a part in the interpretations. (List all details of information- cannot use fake detail but can say prefer not to say on any question given they understand it will lead to more general interpretation.)
(Could create user profile and every dream be remembered and aid in future interpretations of the dreams by them. Would also aid in creating a pattern in todays various groups such as young adults under 30 unmarried and out of work have a recurring pattern in dreams unseen in other groups-would suggest that change is needed in one of these factors and could be the point the dream is wishing to communicate to the conscious self. Which factor still depends upon the individual aand ai should not take any bias in suggesting one particular conclusion. Dreams are had by individual and must be revealed fully by the dreamer themself. )


##AI to turn text into static website*** 
Html CSS JS Python ... implementing whichever best serves the users vision. 
example: I want to make a website where i can sell my electronics store, a home page, about the company page, contacct page with all means of contact, and a shop where i can add the items and services available....
bot then produces the most basic example of the code(code includes<!--tons of explainers as a walkthrough where to change info and guides the user --> )  Allowing those who learn by doing to begin working towards greater understanding of how the code really works.

2. Developer tools-
   WYSiWYG code playground/ website builder free of charge if able to do this with reasonable cost to not need to charge a subscription. Could make it very reasonable cost like less than any subscription on the market. It should be not for turning profits but aiding others who perhaps cannot afford these professional services.. maybe only does static websites with nothing fancy.
   
   Im full of ideas and i will likely add more here before long but also do not wish to get to far ahead of myself as It is somewhat daunting when viewing it as how much I have still to do. May need to break these up into indivual steps/ repositories. Definitely need help and I am unskilled in asking for assistance. I am skilled at failing because of pride. This isnt for me however and generally I work better on aiding some other persons interest than I will work on my own projects. 
   
   This should suffice for the time being. Feel free to contact me with ideas or suggestions I am open to aid even if just pointing me in the direction of where to fnd a solution is greatly appreciated! 
   
            - Sincerely J. B. Martin developer/ owner of JBMarz.com
